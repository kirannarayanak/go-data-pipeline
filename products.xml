Apple is the largest technology company by revenue (totaling US$365. 8 billion in 2021) and as of May 2022, it is the world's second biggest company by market capitalization, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales and second-largest mobile phone manufacturer. It is one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the Apple II became a best seller. Apple went public in 1980, to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the original Macintosh, announced in a critically acclaimed advertisement, "1984", directed by Ridley Scott. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him. As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones (also known as "Wintel"). In 1997, weeks away from bankruptcy, the company bought NeXT to resolve Apple's unsuccessful operating system strategy and entice Jobs back to the company.

The new 6. 7-inch iPhone 16 is called the ""iPhone 16 Plus"". Apple's iPhone 16 models features flat edges, an aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure, and a glass back that enables wireless charging Apple is using the same A18 chip that was in the iPhone 13 Pro models for the iPhone 16 models, but there is an updated internal design that allows for better thermal performance. The A18 chip offers a Hexa-core CPU, a 5-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine. The iPhone 16 models include a dual-core accelerometer that can measure up to 256Gs, and the accelerometer and a high dynamic range gyroscope power a Crash Detection feature that can contact emergency services if you're in a serious accident and can't reach your iPhone. Apple also uses other sensors to power this feature, so the barometer detects changes in cabin pressure, the GPS watches for speed changes, and the microphone can listen for car crash noises.

The new 6. 7-inch iPhone 16 is called the ""iPhone 16 Plus"". Apple's iPhone 16 models features flat edges, an aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure, and a glass back that enables wireless charging Apple is using the same A18 chip that was in the iPhone 13 Pro models for the iPhone 16 models, but there is an updated internal design that allows for better thermal performance. The A18 chip offers a Hexa-core CPU, a 5-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine. The iPhone 16 models include a dual-core accelerometer that can measure up to 256Gs, and the accelerometer and a high dynamic range gyroscope power a Crash Detection feature that can contact emergency services if you're in a serious accident and can't reach your iPhone. Apple also uses other sensors to power this feature, so the barometer detects changes in cabin pressure, the GPS watches for speed changes, and the microphone can listen for car crash noises.
