      <g:title>Apple iPad 2021 (9th Generation) 10.2-Inch, 64GB, WiFi, Silver With Facetime - International Version</g:title>
      <g:description>The A13 Bionic chip makes everything more responsive, from messaging to web browsing to using multiple apps at onceUp to 20% faster GPU gives you the graphics performance you need. Perfect for playing immersive games and moreA more powerful Neural Engine drives machine learning–based features like Live Text in iPadOS 15The A13 Bionic chip effortlessly powers advanced apps like Adobe Fresco and ProcreateWith all-day battery life, iPad is ready to work or play for as long as you need itOverviewApple is a premium brand masquerading as a luxury one, It is one of the best- regarded brands globally, Apple's brand is valued at over $200 billion, in part because of the iPhone. But there's one thing it does that makes it more valuable than the rest, and it's something you can do too. It's almost hard to get a sense of the scale of a company like Apple From latest features to packaging the products, Apple does everything in a way that exhibits the company's uniqueness. Versatility and planning sets the company apart from the rest, making its products loved and coveted by the majority of people. Almost all the characteristics determining apple quality can be measured or classiﬁed. Consumers assess apples by its appearance (colour, size, shape, absence of defects) and then by its eating quality, although the latter may determine the willingness to buy the product again. Get the most out of the devices you love with high‑quality content and services. Award‑winning series and films, amazing music in spatial audio, world-class workouts and meditations, trusted news publications, superfun games even the ways you pay for things and they’re only on Apple. Since Apple has a large market share and is known for its versatile and fast operating system, developers prefer to launch their apps and high-end games first on iOS and then on Android. Further, iOS runs on consistent hardware, while Android comes in different iterations and versions depending on the phone. Apple is a fashion company, and in fashion companies, the role of design is style definition. When they released iOS7 in 2013, Apple signaled a major change in how UI and digital experience played into their company strategy.

That’s why Apple Watch is there to call for help when you need it most. And now it can let someone know when you’ve safely made it to a destination. Need help? Apple Watch has your back. Just press and hold the side button to call emergency services and share your location. Apple Watch can automatically detect if you’ve taken a hard fall or been in a severe car crash. If you need help, it will call emergency services, share your location and notify your emergency contacts. Check In notifies someone when you arrive at a destination. If you’re going for a run after dark, you can start a Check In for the duration of your workout to automatically notify a friend when you’re done. What matters to you matters to Apple too. From using more recycled materials that minimise environmental impact. To privacy protections that give you more control over your data. To creating built‑in features that make Apple Watch accessible to all.

The A18 chip offers a Hexa-core CPU, a 5-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine. The iPhone 16 models include a dual-core accelerometer that can measure up to 256Gs, and the accelerometer and a high dynamic range gyroscope power a Crash Detection feature that can contact emergency services if you're in a serious accident and can't reach your iPhone. Apple also uses other sensors to power this feature, so the barometer detects changes in cabin pressure, the GPS watches for speed changes, and the microphone can listen for car crash noises.

Apple's iPhone 16 models features flat edges, an aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure, and a glass back that enables wireless charging Apple is using the same A15 chip that was in the iPhone 13 Pro models for the iPhone 16 models, but there is an updated internal design that allows for better thermal performance. The A18 chip offers a Hexa-core CPU, a 5-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine. The iPhone 16 models include a dual-core accelerometer that can measure up to 256Gs, and the accelerometer and a high dynamic range gyroscope power a Crash Detection feature that can contact emergency services if you're in a serious accident and can't reach your iPhone. Apple also uses other sensors to power this feature, so the barometer detects changes in cabin pressure, the GPS watches for speed changes, and the microphone can listen for car crash noises.
